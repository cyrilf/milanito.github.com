Hello all,

As it is my first post, I assume I need to introduce myself a bit.

My name is [Matthieu Rondeau](http://matthieurondeau.fr), I am a [web and mobile developer](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rondeaumatthieu).

I have been for the last three year and it is still somthing I'd like to do for a long time.

I mostly develop under Unix like systems. I have been using [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) for the last decade or so, but recently I have been using Mac OS at work.

I am :
* An emacs lover
* An Android lover
* A symfony Framework lover
* A javascript lover

I hope I won't bore you so much in here.

Have a nice day
